### Day 2: Production Deployment (Gradual Rollout)

**Deployment Strategy:** Gradual rollout with canary deployment

**Step 1: Canary Deployment (10% traffic)**
```bash
# Merge to main branch
git checkout main
git merge staging
git tag v3.0.0
git push origin main --tags

# Deploy with 10% traffic split (configure in hosting platform)
# Vercel/Netlify: Use preview branch or canary deployment feature
```

**Monitor for 1 hour:**
- [ ] Error rate < 0.5%
- [ ] Page load time < 3s
- [ ] No critical console errors
- [ ] Analytics tracking functional

**Step 2: 50% Traffic (if canary successful)**
- Increase traffic split to 50%
- Monitor for 2 hours
- Check real-user metrics (Google Analytics, Sentry)

**Step 3: 100% Traffic (if 50% successful)**
- Route all traffic to new version
- Monitor for 4 hours
- Keep old version ready for instant rollback

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Full production deployment
npm run build
npm run deploy:production

# Verify deployment
curl https://bharatgoai.com -I
# Check status: 200 OK
```

**Deliverables:**
